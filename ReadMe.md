## Project Overview

This project is part of the second practical assignment for the AI Introduction course. It focuses on the application of supervised learning techniques to build, evaluate, and compare machine learning models.

**Supervised learning involves:**
- Analyzing and preparing the dataset.
- Identifying the target variable.
- Splitting the data into training and test sets.
- Selecting and tuning a learning algorithm.
- Evaluating the model's performance on the test set.

## Dataset

**Name**: SDSS Galaxy Classification DR18  
**Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bryancimo/sdss-galaxy-classification-dr18)  

### Brief Description
The dataset contains 100,000 rows of photometric image data collected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). It focuses on galaxies classified into two subclasses:
- **STARFORMING**
- **STARBURST**

The SDSS has surveyed about one-third of the sky, identifying nearly 1 billion objects, including almost 3 million galaxies.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `ClassificationTaskNotebook.ipynb` using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to:
   - Preprocess the dataset.
   - Train and evaluate supervised learning models.
   - Compare model performance.

## Libraries Used

The notebook requires the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn`
- `imblearn`
- `scipy`
